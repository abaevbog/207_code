In order to test this program, we need to test if the methods perform what they are supposed to and if the fields set up is correct. 
Thus, we are going to:
1) Create a new shoppingCart object.
2) Test adding more than 3 elements to it, to test if the addItem method is 
correct. 
3) Print these objects to test if print method is correct. This also covers the fields set up in all classes and toString method of all classes
4)Then we should call totalCost method to cover the method itself and getCost 
method of all functions.
5)Then we need to test costPerUnit method by explicitly calling it on all items
in the cart
6)Finally, we will test numberInCart method on an element that's not present in
the cart, an element whose number in the cart is one, and an element with more
than one item of this name in the cart.
Testing resutls: 
Upon running the program, we get the following output: 
Items currently in the cart: 

Item 0:
Name: coffee
Cost: 5.0
Fluid Ounces: 2
Depoist: 0.5

Item 1:
Name: water
Cost: 3.0
Fluid Ounces: 1
Depoist: 0.5

Item 2:
Name: banana
Cost: 2.5
Weight: 1.5
Category: Fruit

Item 3:
Name: carrot
Cost: 1.3
Weight: 0.7
Category: Vegetable

Item 4:
Name: banana
Cost: 2.5
Weight: 1.5
Category: Fruit

Item 5:
Name: noodles
Cost: 4.0
Ounces 2
Size parameters: length 3, width: 3, height: 3

Item 6:
Name: broth
Cost: 3.0
Ounces 1
Size parameters: length 2, width: 2, height: 2

Total price is: 22.3
The cost per unit of coffee is 2.50 
The cost per unit of water is 3.00 
The cost per unit of banana is 1.67 
The cost per unit of carrot is 1.86 
The cost per unit of banana is 1.67 
The cost per unit of noodles is 4.00 
The cost per unit of broth is 3.00 
Number of coffe in the cart: 1
Number of bananas in the cart: 2
Number of toys in the cart: 0

---- output ends here
This means that:
1) we sucecssfully created a shopping cart obejct
2) properly added 6 elements
3)printed all of them, and the format of printed objects is specific to each 
class
4) totalCost method returned the value that corresponds to the one I computed manually (22.3)
5)numberInCart returns 0 for element no in the cart, 1 for 1 coffee in the cart and 2 for 2 bananas in the cart.

Based on that, I believe that we have covered all methods and fields in the classes above, and the program works as intended.
